This is Atul's convoluted build pipeline for cross-assembling
and running 6502 assembly programs on an Apple II using a Mac.

See [Rationale][#rationale] for more details on why I made this.

## Prerequisites

1. Get [Virtual II][].
2. Install Java 11 (e.g., `brew install openjdk@11`). Sadly
   this is required to run [AppleCommander], which builds disk
   images for us.
3. Build and install [Merlin32][].

## Building and running programs

Set up a Virtual II machine running an Apple II+ (IIe is okay too)
and put DOS 3.3 (included in the `disks` subdirectory) in disk
drive 1. Make sure it's currently running.

Now in a terminal, run `./compile [program]` where program is the
base name (without the trailing `.s` or the directory name) of
a file in the `src` directory.

For example, `./compile printa` will act upon `src/printa.s`.

This will compile the program, put its binary in a disk at
`disks/boop.dsk`, insert the disk into drive 2 of your
Apple VM, and run the program (which is always called `BOOP`).

## Rationale

I was working through the tutorials in Robert Wagner's _Assembly Lines_
articles from the early 1980s and had a few issues with running
Merlin on the Apple II:

* It seemed like all the versions of Merlin I could find online were
  from a different time period than the original tutorials were
  written. Some things the tutorial told me to do weren't working
  at all.

* Even once I stumbled into getting _something_ working with Merlin,
  modifying my code and seeing its effects took a lot of keystrokes.

  At first I thought I was just spoiled by the conveniences of
  modern development, but then I realized that even Integer BASIC
  on the Apple II makes it easy to iterate on one's code--once you're
  done modifying things you just type `RUN` and you can see its effects.

  But with Merlin, I had to switch through multiple different modes in the
  program to compile my code, manually load the binary into the
  proper region in memory, and then run it. It was all a bit of a
  hassle and quite error-prone.

* Even though I theoretically liked the idea of fully role-playing
  a computer programmer from 1982, I wasn't terribly interested in
  becoming fluent with Merlin, which was an extremely primitive
  code editor by today's standards.

So even though this pipeline I've made is a bit overkill, at
least it makes it possible for me to get in a flow state with
my code and quickly try things out.
