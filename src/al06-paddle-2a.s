* AL05-PADDLE PROGRAM 2A from Assembly Lines, pg. 3

* Note that running this on Virtual ][ requries paddle config.
* Easiest way to do this is to use the pull-down menu option
* "Quick settings -> Use Arrows as Joystick".
* This isn't ideal because it only sends 3 discrete values,
* but it's better than nothing.

* Note that the original program displayed only when the
* paddle's value was within the ASCII range, but because
* the Virtual ]['s arrows->joystick emulation only allows
* the paddle to be 0, 127, or 255, I modified the original
* to display 'L' when the user is pressing the left arrow,
* and 'R' when they are pressing the right arrow.
